# NetIntel-OCR Use Cases: Building Semantic CMDBs for Telcos and Security Providers

## Executive Summary

NetIntel-OCR's ultimate goal is to enable the creation of **Semantic Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs)** that transform traditional asset management into intelligent, context-aware systems. Document extraction is merely the first step in building comprehensive knowledge graphs that understand the complex relationships between network elements, security controls, and business services.

For telecommunications companies and security service providers, NetIntel-OCR provides the foundation for semantic intelligence that goes far beyond simple document search, enabling predictive analytics, automated impact analysis, and intelligent decision-making.

## The Vision: Semantic CMDB as the Core

### What is a Semantic CMDB?

A Semantic CMDB represents a paradigm shift from traditional databases to knowledge graphs:

- **RDF Triples**: Subject-predicate-object relationships (e.g., "Router-connects-to-Switch")
- **Context-Aware**: Understanding not just connections but their purpose and impact
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Adapting to network changes and evolving architectures
- **Inference Capabilities**: Deriving new knowledge from existing relationships

### Document Extraction: The Foundation Layer

```
Traditional Approach:          Semantic CMDB Approach:
Documents → Storage            Documents → Extraction → Knowledge Graph
    ↓                                         ↓              ↓
Manual Search                         RDF Triples    Intelligent Queries
    ↓                                         ↓              ↓
Static Results                        Relationships   Predictive Analytics
```

NetIntel-OCR transforms unstructured documents into structured knowledge:
1. **Extract** network diagrams, tables, and text
2. **Identify** entities and their relationships
3. **Generate** RDF triples for semantic representation
4. **Build** queryable knowledge graphs
5. **Enable** intelligent operations

## Telecommunications Use Cases

### 1. Building Intelligent Network Operations Centers (NOCs)

#### The Semantic CMDB Transformation

**Traditional NOC Challenges:**
- Scattered documentation across multiple systems
- No understanding of service dependencies
- Manual correlation during incidents
- Static, outdated network views

**Semantic CMDB Solution:**

NetIntel-OCR processes network documentation to build a living knowledge graph:

```rdf
# Network Infrastructure Graph
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <connects-to> <Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-01>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <provides-service> <MPLS:Customer-A>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <has-backup> <Router:CR-NYC-02>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <located-in> <DataCenter:NYC-1>
<DataCenter:NYC-1> <has-power-source> <PowerGrid:ConEd-Feed-A>
```

**Intelligent Query Examples:**

```sparql
# Impact Analysis Query
"What services will be affected if CR-NYC-01 fails?"

Semantic CMDB Analysis:
→ 47 customer circuits identified
→ 3 peering sessions affected
→ Backup path via CR-NYC-02 available
→ 12 dependent services require notification
→ Historical data: 2.3 hour average recovery time
```

**Operational Benefits:**
- **70% reduction** in incident resolution time

SELECT ?affected_service ?impact_level WHERE {
  ?component failure_affects ?affected_service .
  ?affected_service has_sla ?sla .
  ?sla criticality ?impact_level .
}
```

#### Compliance Verification
```sparql
# Are all critical assets properly protected?
SELECT ?asset ?missing_control WHERE {
  ?asset criticality "High" .
  ?requirement applies_to ?asset .
  NOT EXISTS { ?asset protected_by ?required_control }
}
```

#### Capacity Planning
```sparql
# Where will we hit capacity limits?
SELECT ?resource ?days_to_exhaustion WHERE {
  ?resource current_utilization ?current .
  ?resource growth_rate ?rate .
  ?resource maximum_capacity ?max .
  BIND((?max - ?current) / ?rate AS ?days_to_exhaustion)
  FILTER(?days_to_exhaustion < 180)
