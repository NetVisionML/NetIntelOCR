# NetIntel-OCR Business Use Cases and Privacy Requirements for Telecommunications and Network Service Providers

## Executive Summary

NetIntel-OCR addresses critical requirements for telecommunications companies and network service providers who must process vast amounts of network documentation, infrastructure diagrams, and regulatory filings while maintaining data sovereignty and meeting FCC compliance requirements. By leveraging local Ollama models instead of cloud-based AI services, telcos can process sensitive network infrastructure documents, customer deployment architectures, and regulatory documentation without exposing critical infrastructure details to external services.

**The ultimate goal of NetIntel-OCR is to enable the creation of a Semantic Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** that transforms traditional asset management into an intelligent, context-aware system using semantic relationships and graph-based knowledge representation.

## The Vision: Semantic CMDB for Network Intelligence

### What is a Semantic CMDB?

A Semantic CMDB utilizes a semantic data model, often based on Resource Description Framework (RDF), to represent relationships between configuration items (CIs) within an IT environment. This approach uses a subject-predicate-object structure, also known as "triples," to map relationships, offering a richer understanding of how assets are interconnected. Unlike relational CMDBs that rely on unique keys for relationships, semantic CMDBs leverage descriptive relationships to provide more context.

### Why Semantic CMDB for Telecommunications?

Traditional CMDBs in telco environments suffer from:
- **Static Relationships**: Fixed schemas that can't adapt to dynamic network changes
- **Limited Context**: Unable to capture the rich relationships between network elements
- **Poor Integration**: Difficulty connecting documentation with live configuration data
- **Manual Updates**: Require constant manual maintenance to stay current

NetIntel-OCR enables Semantic CMDB by:
- **Extracting Network Relationships**: Automatically identifying connections from network diagrams
- **Building Knowledge Graphs**: Converting documentation into RDF triples
- **Creating Contextual Links**: Understanding relationships like "connects-to," "depends-on," "provides-service-for"
- **Enabling Intelligent Queries**: Supporting complex queries like "Show all components that could be affected by a fiber cut at location X"

### Semantic CMDB Architecture with NetIntel-OCR

```
Network Documentation → NetIntel-OCR Processing → RDF Triple Generation
                                                          ↓
                                                  Semantic Knowledge Graph
                                                          ↓
                                              Intelligent CMDB Queries
```

Example RDF Triple from Network Diagram:
```
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <connects-to> <Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-01>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <has-protocol> <BGP>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <serves-location> <DataCenter:NYC-1>
<Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-01> <has-redundancy-with> <Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-02>
```
