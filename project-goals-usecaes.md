# NetIntel-OCR Business Use Cases and Privacy Requirements for Telecommunications, Network and Security Service Providers

## Executive Summary

NetIntel-OCR addresses critical requirements for telecommunications companies, network service providers, and security service providers who must process vast amounts of network documentation, security architecture diagrams, threat intelligence reports, and regulatory filings while maintaining data sovereignty and meeting compliance requirements. By leveraging local Ollama models instead of cloud-based AI services, organizations can process sensitive infrastructure documents, security architectures, incident response playbooks, and regulatory documentation without exposing critical infrastructure or security details to external services.

**The ultimate goal of NetIntel-OCR is to enable the creation of a Semantic Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** that transforms traditional asset management into an intelligent, context-aware system using semantic relationships and graph-based knowledge representation, enhanced with security context and threat intelligence.

## The Vision: Semantic CMDB for Network Intelligence

### What is a Semantic CMDB?

A Semantic CMDB utilizes a semantic data model, often based on Resource Description Framework (RDF), to represent relationships between configuration items (CIs) within an IT environment. This approach uses a subject-predicate-object structure, also known as "triples," to map relationships, offering a richer understanding of how assets are interconnected. Unlike relational CMDBs that rely on unique keys for relationships, semantic CMDBs leverage descriptive relationships to provide more context.

### Why Semantic CMDB for Telecommunications and Security Providers?

Traditional CMDBs in telco and security environments suffer from:
- **Static Relationships**: Fixed schemas that can't adapt to dynamic network changes or evolving threats
- **Limited Context**: Unable to capture relationships between network elements and security controls
- **Poor Integration**: Difficulty connecting documentation with live configuration and security data
- **Manual Updates**: Require constant manual maintenance to stay current
- **No Security Context**: Missing threat intelligence and vulnerability relationships

NetIntel-OCR enables Semantic CMDB by:
- **Extracting Network & Security Relationships**: Identifying connections from network and security architecture diagrams
- **Building Security-Aware Knowledge Graphs**: Converting documentation into RDF triples with security context
- **Creating Contextual Links**: Understanding relationships like "protects," "monitors," "mitigates-threat," "has-vulnerability"
- **Enabling Security Intelligence Queries**: Supporting queries like "Show all assets protected by this firewall" or "Find attack paths to critical assets"

### Semantic CMDB Architecture with NetIntel-OCR

```
Network Documentation → NetIntel-OCR Processing → RDF Triple Generation
                                                          ↓
                                                  Semantic Knowledge Graph
                                                          ↓
                                              Intelligent CMDB Queries
```

Example RDF Triples from Network and Security Diagrams:

**Network Infrastructure:**
```
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <connects-to> <Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-01>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <has-protocol> <BGP>
<Router:CR-NYC-01> <serves-location> <DataCenter:NYC-1>
<Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-01> <has-redundancy-with> <Switch:SW-NYC-CORE-02>
```

**Security Architecture:**
```
<Firewall:FW-EDGE-01> <protects> <Network:DMZ>
<Firewall:FW-EDGE-01> <monitors-traffic-from> <Router:CR-NYC-01>
<IDS:SNORT-01> <detects-threats-on> <Network:DMZ>
<SIEM:Splunk> <aggregates-logs-from> <Firewall:FW-EDGE-01>
<WAF:CloudFlare> <mitigates-attacks-for> <Application:WebPortal>
<Scanner:Nessus> <scans-vulnerabilities-on> <Network:Internal>
